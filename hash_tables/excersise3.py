#                          How many times
#  Write a function how_many_times that receives a string (like a short sentence text) and a word
#  and returns the number of times that word is repeated in the sentence.
#  Example, given the following sentence:


def how_many_times(a_string, a_word):
    
    return a_string.count(a_word)
